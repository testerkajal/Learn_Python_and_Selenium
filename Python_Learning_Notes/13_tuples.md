>Tuples are indexed, can include duplicate value, and cannot be modified(immutable)\
 Tuples can include items of different data types\
 Tuples are declared with ()

# Define
```py
demo_tuple1 = ("kajal",1,1,2,3,False)
print(demo_tuple1[0]) 
result: kajal
```

## As mentioned above we can't modify the tuples. so we can't use below methods.\
```py
demo_tuple1.append()
demo_tuple1.remove()
demo_tuple1.pop()
```

## To check the length of the tuple
```py
print(len(demo_tuple1)) #i.e 6
```
